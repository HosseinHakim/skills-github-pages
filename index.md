# ðŸ”³ Learning GitHub Pages
## Road Map: â‡¢
   The story behind: I wanted to build a site for myself working as a resume and a place 
   for sharing my photoes.
- I accidently Found _Material design_ on web
- After an hour I was browsing in *GitHub*
- I created a GitHub Account
- Instaled Latest version of *git* on my windows
- As you can guess *Visual Studio* has been downloaded
